# Analysis-of-Student-Performance
The objective of this project is to analyze student performance and to predict whether a student would pass or fail based on their performance dataset. In order to achieve this goal, various data preprocessing techniques were applied, including removing irrelevant information, label encoding, and binning. Binary classification using Decision Tree Classifier was then used to build a model to make predictions.
The model has a more-than-satisfactory accuracy of 98%. A confusion matrix has been illustrated to visualize the correctness of the model.
